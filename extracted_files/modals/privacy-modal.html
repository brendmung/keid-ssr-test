            <p>Your privacy matters to us. This policy explains what information we collect when you use Keid and how we use it to make our marketplace work better for everyone.</p>

            <h3>What Information We Collect</h3>
            <p>When you create a Keid account, we need your name, email, and phone number so other users can contact you about transactions. We also store the listings you create, including photos and descriptions of what you're selling or the services you offer.</p>

            <p>We also pay attention to how you use the platform - what categories you browse, which listings you view, and how you navigate around Keid. This helps us understand what's working well and what we can improve.</p>

            <h3>How We Use Your Information</h3>
            <p>Everything we collect helps us connect buyers and sellers in our community. We use your contact information to send you important notifications about your account and transactions. When someone wants to buy something from you, we share your contact details so you can arrange the sale.</p>

            <p>We analyze usage patterns to make Keid easier to use and add features that our community actually wants. We also use this information to spot suspicious activity and keep scammers off the platform.</p>

            <h3>What We Don't Do With Your Information</h3>
            <p>We don't sell your personal information to anyone. We're not in the business of collecting data to sell to advertisers or marketing companies. Your information stays within the Keid community where it belongs.</p>

            <h3>When We Share Information</h3>
            <p>The main time we share your information is when you're making a transaction - buyers and sellers need each other's contact details to complete their deals.</p>

            <p>We work with some service providers who help us run Keid's technical systems, but they're bound by strict agreements to keep your information confidential and use it only for helping us operate the platform.</p>

            <h3>Keeping Your Information Safe</h3>
            <p>We use encryption to protect your data when it travels between your device and our servers, and we encrypt stored data too. Our team regularly reviews our security practices and updates our protections. Only the people who absolutely need access to your information to help run Keid can see it.</p>

            <h3>Your Control Over Your Information</h3>
            <p>You can update your account information anytime through your profile settings. If you decide to leave Keid, you can delete your account and we'll remove your personal information.</p>

            <h3>How Long We Keep Your Information</h3>
            <p>We keep your account information as long as your account is active. If you don't use Keid for a couple of years, we might delete inactive accounts to keep our systems clean.</p>

            <h3>Questions About Privacy</h3>
            <p>If you have questions about how we handle your information or want to exercise any of your privacy rights, you can reach us through the platform's help section or contact us directly. We're always happy to explain how we protect your privacy.</p>
