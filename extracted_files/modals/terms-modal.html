            <p>By using Keid, you're joining our local marketplace community. These terms help ensure everyone has a positive experience buying and selling with their neighbors.</p>

            <h3>Who Can Use Keid</h3>
            <p>You need to be 18 or older to create an account, or have your parent's permission if you're younger. Each account is personal to you and can't be shared or transferred to someone else.</p>

            <h3>Creating Good Listings</h3>
            <p>When you list something for sale, make sure your description is honest and your photos show what you're actually selling. Price your items fairly and keep your listings updated. We don't allow illegal items, weapons, or anything that could harm our community.</p>

            <h3>Being a Good Community Member</h3>
            <p>Whether you're buying or selling, treat others with respect. Sellers should respond to messages quickly and deliver what they promise. Buyers should pay as agreed and communicate clearly about any issues. We all share responsibility for keeping Keid a safe, trustworthy place to do business.</p>

            <h3>How Transactions Work</h3>
            <p>Keid connects you with other users, but we don't handle payments or deliveries directly. You and the other person work out the details of payment and pickup or delivery. When meeting someone, choose safe, public places and trust your instincts.</p>

            <h3>What's Not Allowed</h3>
            <p>Don't spam, harass other users, or try to scam anyone. Be honest in your listings and communications. Don't use Keid for anything illegal or try to work around our safety features. We want everyone to feel comfortable using our platform.</p>

            <h3>Account Issues</h3>
            <p>If someone repeatedly breaks these rules or makes others feel unsafe, we may need to suspend or close their account. We don't take this lightly, but community safety comes first.</p>

            <h3>Our Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>Keid provides the platform that connects you with other users, but we can't guarantee that every transaction will go perfectly. Users are responsible for their own buying and selling decisions. While we'll help resolve disputes when we can, we can't be held liable for problems between users.</p>

            <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>
            <p>Sometimes we need to update these terms as Keid grows and evolves. We'll let you know about important changes, and continuing to use Keid means you accept the updated terms.</p>
